#(Statements, Variables, Data Types, & Arrays) from JavaScript & jQuery: Interactive Front-End Web Development

How do you declare a variable. What does the equals sign really mean in JavaScript? What is it called in JavaScript?

-To declare a variable you use the variable keyword var and give it a name(identifier). Then you are able to assign a value to the variable with the assignment operator (=). The variable is undefined until then.
-The equals _updates_ the value of a variable.
-In javascript the equals sign is called an assignment operator.


There are three big data types in JavaScript: numbers, strings, and booleans. Describe what each of them are.

-"The numeric data type handles numbers."
-"The string data type consists of letters and characters." They are frequently used to add new content into a page and they can contain HTML markup.
-"The boolean data types can have one of two values: true or false." You can think of boolean variables as either on or off. They help determine which part of a script should run. (Pg. 62)

What are the six rules for naming variables? What are a few JavaScript reserved words that you should avoid using for variable names?

1. The name of the variable has to begin with either a letter, a dollar sign, or an underscore. It cannot start with a number.
2. The name can contain letters, numbers, the dollar sign, or an underscore. You cannot use a dash or a period in a variable name.
3. Keywords and reserved words cannot be used as variable names.
4. Variables are case sensitive.
5. You should choose a name that describes the type of information that the variable is storing.
6. Use camel case or underscore.

Await, class, else, do, for are some examples of reserved words in JS.

How can an array be useful when dealing with multiple related values? How do you access/change a value in an array?

-Arrays can be helpful in dealing with multiple related values in that when you create an array, you do not have to specify how many values you want to hold. Therefore you do not have to create a variable for each item in the list.
-To access or change a value in an array you have to access the value by specifying the index number for the value inside of square brackets (ie if you have an array named "colors" you might use colors[2] to access the 3 item in that list/array). To change the value you can use the assignment operator and assigning a new value (colors[2]= "purple").

What is the difference between an expression and a statement?

-Expressions _evaluate_ to a single value. There are two types: expressions that just assign a value to a variable, and expressions that use two or more values to return a single value. (Note: expressions rely on operators, ie assignment operators(=), arithmetic operators(*), string operators(+), comparison operators(>) and logical operators(&&)).
-An individual instruction or a step in a script is known as a statement.

What are three types of operators and how are they used?

-arithmetic operators: mathematical operators that can use numbers and perform math. They might be used to calculate the total cost or subtotal or to add items in a cart.
-string operators: This (+) is used to combine strings. You might use this to personalize your messages/greetings on webpages/personalize data!
-comparison operators: compare values and return true or false. You might use this to evaluate a condition in order to run specific code you might need in different situations.
