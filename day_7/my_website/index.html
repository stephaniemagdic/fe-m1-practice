      <p>
        I tried yoga 8 years ago, and it has been such a fun practice that has really been one of my favorie hobbies.
        I think it could be beneficial for everyone to give it a chance! Look through the site to learn more about its benefit
        and to meet people who have tried it.

      <h2>Yoga Journey</h2>
      <p>
        The first day I tried a yoga video, I thought
        "oh my gosh, this is so hard. There must be something to it." 8 years later...

        While in Turing, I am planning to challenge myself to strengthen my yoga practice. What better time than when I know
        I am going to need its benefits!
