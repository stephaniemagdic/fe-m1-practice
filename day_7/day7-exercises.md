After you're done reading the third post, read through the each section of questions again: Psychology, Usability, Design, Copywriting, and Analysis. Choose one question from each of these sections (so 5 total questions), and find one site that is good at supporting that question, and find another site that violates that question.

Post links to the sites and brief descriptions in your day7-exercises.md file.


1. How much work does the user have to do to get what they want?
  [roomster](https://roomster.com): The user does not have much work to do. The objectives (renting a room and finding a room are right there on the page in view when opening the page)
  facebook: Browsing is the purpose and posting status which are designed well. The first thing you see is "Whats on your mind stephanie?" Then you see notifcation signs to pull you in and a newsfeed on the same page. Its a site that definitely considers a user's psychology and wants a user to come again often.
  [alfredsung.com](https://alfredsung.com): a site not designed so well is alfredsung which looks like it is an online shop. The reason that it does not seem to work for a person's psychology is the purpose is not easy to see upon first reaching the website so the user has to work pretty hard to get to what they want and they might leave simply becuase it is not intuitive.
2.Are there any user mistakes you could prevent? (Hint: Yes, there are.)// Have you provided everything the user needs to know?

  From experience poor usability are many school websites: Most of the time there are user errors and no information that catches those errors to tell the users their mistakes. There are also often not enough information to find the pages you need. IE it is hard to find the person or email address you are looking for and once you do it is hard to access that information to contact the person.

  [trello](https://trello.com}: On the other hand, trello is very usable. It will correct many of your mistakes. Popup boxes will make sure you want to complete actions and prompts and events will help to move you along to create cards, delete cards, add notes on cards, etc. If you don't know exactly how to do one of these steps, trello will make assumptions and help you along in the process, making the site very usable.

3. Design: Do users think it looks good? Do they trust it immediately?
https://www.ae.com/
[exmouth view hotel](http://exmouthview.weebly.com/): this website is difficult to trust simply becuase links aren't clickable, each div or section does not have a uniform look and the general uniform is sloppy.
[aerie](https://www.ae.com/): this website immediately looks trustworthy. It has clickable icons and a nav bar that changes colors when clicked on. It has readable design. Very trustworthy and it simply looks good, making it professional and legit.

4.Copywriting: Does it reduce anxiety?
Is it clear, direct, simple, and functional?
[uat.edu](https://www.uat.edu/): This does not reduce anxiety. I think if I were having to look for a degree or were trying to fill out an application I would be confused and overwhelmed.
[google.com](https://google.com): I think google is very simple and direct. It has a clear search bar that is simple direct and functional and has all the right functinality and then it has a few icons that then lead to more functionality. Too much is not put on one page like uat but your directed to more pages and applications with other uses.

5. Analysis:
[kaiser permanente](https://healthy.kaiserpermanente.org/colorado/front-door): At the very bottom website feedback is collected if you choose.
It is hard to say which websites do not have good anyalysis without seeing its code. I see that analysis includes tracking information about how the user is using the page to improve the website/code, such as what is clicked on, time on page, views, how the page is navigated.
(http://www.pandminc.com/) : I would say a website where it is not easy to submit a complaint like coursera or an error or to get in contact with someone has poor analysis. I would take this random website and assume it does not have good analysis as it does not seem to collect information from the user at least by what we can see as the user.
